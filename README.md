# Antivirus Project

## AIV: Advanced Intrusion Visualization & Analysis
- Welcome to AIV, a sophisticated system for packet analysis, process scanning, and static analysis of Portable Executable (PE) files. This project integrates a Windows client console application developed in C# with multiple microservices built using FastAPI, providing functionality similar to Wireshark alongside advanced machine learning analysis for security monitoring.

### Project Overview
##### AIV is designed to serve as a comprehensive packet analysis and security monitoring tool with the following objectives:

* Packet Analysis & Presentation: A client console application written in C# that captures, analyzes, and displays network packets (similar to Wireshark) in real time.

* Process Scanning: It scans all running processes using the executable along with machine learning techniques to detect unusual process behaviors.

* Static PE Analysis: Performs static analysis on .NET binaries by extracting detailed information from executable (EXE) and dynamic link library (DLL) files. It leverages the EMBER dataset for in-depth static analysis.

### Machine Learning Microservices:
- Autoencoder for Packet Analysis: A custom autoencoder model to identify anomalous packets.
- Transformer Encoder for Classification: A FastAPI microservice that uses a transformer encoder architecture to classify unusual packets.
- Backend Service: A FastAPI-based backend routes client requests to the appropriate microservices.
- Database: A simple MySQL microservice is prepared for storing and managing project-specific data, with custom table schemas (currently in development/standalone).

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Components
##### Client Application (C#)

Developed as a Windows console application.

Responsibilities:

Capture and analyze network packets.

Present data in a user-friendly format.

Scan running processes to identify suspicious activities.

Extract details from EXE and DLL files using the EMBER dataset.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#### Microservices
##### The project utilizes Docker to deploy and manage microservices which are built with FastAPI:

##### Autoencoder Service

Purpose: Detect unusual network packets using your custom autoencoder model.

Deployment: Available as a Docker image (itay601/itay601-images:autoencoder-v1.0).

##### Transformer Service

Purpose: Classify packets for security analysis.

Deployment: Available as a Docker image (itay601/itay601-images:transformer-v1.0).

##### Backend Routing Service

Purpose: Acts as the central hub that routes requests between the client and other microservices.

Deployment: Available as a Docker image (itay601/itay601-images:v1.0).

##### Database (MySQL)

A basic MySQL microservice has been set up to handle data storage.

Status: The database includes foundational table structures and schema design, with integration to the other components currently in progress.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#### Features

Real-Time Packet Analysis: Monitor live network traffic similar to Wireshark.

Process and Static PE Analysis: Comprehensive scanning and analysis of running processes and .NET binaries.

Anomaly Detection with Autoencoder: Automated detection of unusual network activity.

Classification with Transformer Encoder: High-performance classification of abnormal packets.

Microservice Deployment: All major services are containerized with Docker for scalability and ease of deployment.

Modular Architecture: Easily extendable and maintainable structure to support future enhancements.

Local Setup with Docker
Prerequisites
Docker: Ensure you have Docker installed on your local machine. You can download it from Docker's official website.
Pull the Microservices
Open your terminal and pull the required Docker images using the following commands:

docker pull itay601/itay601-images:autoencoder-v1.0
docker pull itay601/itay601-images:transformer-v1.0
docker pull itay601/itay601-images:v1.0  # (Backend Routing Service)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#### Usage
Run the Microservices:
Start each image using Docker:

bash

Copy
docker run -d -p 5000:5000 itay601/itay601-images:autoencoder-v1.0
docker run -d -p 5001:5001 itay601/itay601-images:transformer-v1.0
docker run -d -p 5002:5002 itay601/itay601-images:v1.0


Start the Client:

Launch the downloaded Windows client application. Ensure that the microservices are accessible from the client by configuring the correct endpoint URIs if necessary.

Monitor & Analyze:

Utilize the client to capture network packets, scan running processes, and perform static analysis on .NET binaries.
